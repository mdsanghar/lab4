Predict fish weight using fish dimensions
Description
In this project I have used fish dataset which can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market.
I have used linear regression model to predict the weight of the fish using other dimensions provided in the dataset, Length 1,length 2, Length 3, Height and width.

You can go to this link: https://fishweightprediction.herokuapp.com/ and input the fish dimensions to predcit its weight.

To create/modify the app you will need
To run your own version, you can copy the files from the git repo, then make your modifications, then re-deploy it in Heroku and generate your own link. Files to modify:

1-Create a model using pickle which can predict weight(In my App its named " Classifier").

2-Create Flask webframe like "myflask"

3-An HTML file to create a webpage ("html.index")

4-And an Css(Cascading Style Sheet) "style.css" to help organize display format in web page.
